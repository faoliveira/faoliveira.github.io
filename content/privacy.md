This website is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), an open-source static website generator. 

Containing an Analytics script from Google. Unfortunately, it’s the free option for now, but it’s in the pipeline to switch to a lighter option that better respects user privacy such as Plausible. It’s possible to see in more detail what is captured by GA4 in its [documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11593727?hl=en).

I use the information only to determine which posts are most popular, how much time a person spends on the site, where it is most accessed, etc.

Use of [Hugo's privacy settings](https://gohugo.io/about/hugo-and-gdpr/) to try to minimize as much as possible the collection of unnecessary information such as respectDoNotTrack from Google Analytics, which makes GA respect the “Do Not Track” HTTP header.
